            <p>The Chaos Gods are entities of great power which rule the psychic dimension beneath the physical
                universe, which is known as the Immaterium. Beings which were created by and continue to be sustained by
                the collective emotions and desires of every sentient in the universe. Beliefs or emotions that grow
                strong enough in the physical universe, result in the creation of their sentient embodiments in the
                Immaterium. The greatest and most malevolent of them are the Gods of Chaos. Single-minded monomaniacal
                beings who embody a single concept or emotion, and are therefore dependent on the mortals' emotions for
                not only their powers but their existence too. Because of this, converting mortals into their worshipers
                is their primary if not sole goal, with universal domination the prize. Daemons are psychic entities
                which they've created, whose character and appearance are reflections of their maker's nature. Which can
                be reabsorbed back into their god at any time.</p>
